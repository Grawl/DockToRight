DockToRight
===========

Chrome dev tools theme designed for use with dock-to-right feature. It optimizes the panel so that it is usable being tall and slim. 

## Features
- New dock icons (mostly to make them occupy less space)
- Vertical split view instead of horizontal
- Scrollable Network tab
- Console as first tab (so it's visible even if you don't have space for all tabs)
- Sliding Styles panels by pressing Esc (when you are focusing on the styles instead of the DOM tree)

## Platforms
Currently this theme is designed for the Mac. There will be a little trouble on Windows and Linux where the close button is on the right instead of the left. I will be glad if anyone is willing to fix those. I will be more than happy to put them back in. 

## Installation

Copy `Custom.css` to `User Stylesheets` in your Chrome folder. The locations of the folders are as listed: 

Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/User StyleSheets/Custom.css`

PC: `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\User StyleSheets\Custom.css`
